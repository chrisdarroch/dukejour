# dukejour

dukejour is a shared jukebox - a way for people control a central iTunes instance and vote for songs to be played.

It's great for offices if the people you work with are the kind of people you'd like to listen to music to. Or for coworking spaces or a jelly.

## installation

...right now is a bit of a bitch. Let me explain:

### dependencies

- OSX (10.6 is what we've been developing on, but no reason 10.5 shouldn't work)
- iTunes, set up just so (see later)
- rb-appscript to talk to iTunes
- Juggernaut for the event notification
